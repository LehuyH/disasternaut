## Story

HUGE <code>(Humans United on Galactic Exploration)</code> is offering ANYONE the chance to **own their very own planet**. 

Do you have what it takes to turn the planet into self-sustaining and profitable society? 
Or will the planet's harsh environment end up being YOUR demise? 

If you think you are up for the challenge of **maintaining life against bombardments of asteroids, floods, lava, laser beams, and even nuclear war**, then you are invited to claim this wonderful planet.

No strings attached, no cost to you. HUGE will provide all the tools you need to set up the most sustainable environment you can dream of and live in comfort from day 1.

**The planet is yours to do with as you please, so long as you adhere to the planetary policy.**
âœ“ Make the planet a home where the environment is fully self-sustaining.
âœ“ Extract and export resources for the HUGE community
